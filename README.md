# visar-analysis
GUI for line visar analysis

This GUI-based application ran in IDL (as of 2012) and was extensively used to analyze line-visar data from laser-driven shock-wave and ramp-wave experiments. The code was initially written in 2001-2002 and progressively improved for several years but has not been altered since 2011.
